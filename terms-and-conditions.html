                                    (December to January). The internship start date depends on the Candidate’s growth
                                    cycle completion date and internship availability. However, Company intends to
                                    provide the internship as early as possible.</li>
                                <li>The Company doesn’t guarantee any minimum stipend. The internship can be remote or
                                    physical, based on the requirements of the hiring company.</li>
                                <li>The Candidate understands and accepts that internship selection is contingent upon
                                    their performance in the hiring process and the criteria set by the hiring company.
                                    The Company holds no responsibility for non-selection. The Candidate commits to
                                    follow and actively cooperate with the hiring company&#x27;s selection process.</li>
                                <li>Candidates must apply for all available internship opportunities and participate in
                                    all interviews facilitated by the company upon completing a growth cycle. Upon
                                    successfully securing an internship after completing a growth cycle, the Candidate
                                    must join the hiring company as scheduled. Failure to adhere to either of these
                                    requirements will result in the Company not facilitating any further internships
                                    with respect to that Growth Cycle. However, the Candidate will still be eligible for
                                    internships to be offered for completion of other Growth Cycles.</li>

                                    (Ex: background verification failure).</li>
                                <li>Company is not responsible for providing further internships, if any hiring company
                                    terminates a candidate&#x27;s internship before completion for reasons attributable
                                    to the Candidate&#x27;s performance and conduct, as per its internal policies.</li>
                                <li>The candidate must be of legal age as per the law of the land (India) to be eligible
                                    for the internship.</li>
